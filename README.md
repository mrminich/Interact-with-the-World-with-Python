# Interact with the World with Python
http://sites.psu.edu/edugaming2018/conference-schedule/workshops/ 
Secondary school students are already connected to the world. Whether you teach middle school family and consumer science or high school physics, your students can learn to write Python computer code to interact with relevant data and multimedia through the Internet. Tapping into their existing logic such as “if my phone battery is dead, then plug it in” and with some legal copy and pasting, students can create interactive computer applications that draw them further into various subjects. Free online sets of data (API’s and web services) and code libraries are widely available to lower the learning curve for everyone from 10 to 90. And, students can build conversational dialogue into practical programs or games. In no time at all students who like to communicate and even those who are intimidated by math will be motivated to make their own computer programs.
